NIUI (pronounced new-ee) is an open source interface of the OpenNI library for the Unreal Engine.

It is an abstracted layer of the OpenNI library made specifically for games interactions within the Unreal Engine.

Your copy of NIUI should include a bunch UnrealScript wrapper code, a variety of Unreal Demos showing how to intergrate NIUI
into your UDK games, a heap of c++ source code for the dll and finally the NIUI.dll.

Please bear in mind this is a VERY early version of NIUI and as such it is not a mature API.
The best way for me to improve NIUI is for people tell me what features they would like to see in NIUI and to road-test
the API in your games.
